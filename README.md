# Object-Oriented-Design-and-Program
Practiced different design patterns, did unit test and used Ant to compile/build programs.

Project 1: Implemented Calculator and did unit test. Paid attention to the case when the divisor is 0;

Project 2: Enumeration-based design and design improvement with Static Factory Method.

Project 3: Singleton Design Pattern. Tested the Singleton class to make sure that its getInstance() returns the identical     instance.

Project 4: Praticed using assertArrayEquals and assertSame in unit test.

Project 5: Composite Design Pattern. Implemented File System using Singleton and Composite Design Pattern.

Project 6: Proxy Design Pattern. Added Link as a proxy of a directory or file in File System.

Project 7: Implemented APFS with Factory Method, Composite and Proxy.

Project 8: Visitor Design Pattern. Defined FSVisitor in the APFS package.

Project 9: Strategy Design Pattern.  Implement three comparator classes for the Car class.

Project 10: Observer Design Pattern. Multicast Design Pattern. Implement an Observer example and its Multicast version.

Project 11: Implement an improved version of java.util.Observable and java.util.Observer. Use the enchanced ones to implement the Observer design pattern.

Project 12: Use Strategy design pattern to implement three comparator classes for sorting FS elements. Re-sorts FS elements based on a custom sorting policy, which is indicted by the method parameter, and returns re-sorted FS elements.

Project 13: State Design Pattern. Allow an object to change its behavior according to its state. Implement the DVD example with State design pattern and Singleton design pattern.

Project 14: Lambda expression. Revise project 9 with lambda expressions.

Project 15: Revise project 12 with lambda expressions.
